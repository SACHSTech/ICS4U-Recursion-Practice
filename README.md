# Recursion Practice

Write a recursive solution to each of the following problems. They are organized in increasing difficulty, beginning with the easiest. 

## 1. Count Up Timer
Write a recursive function `countUp(int n)` that takes a parameter n (the stopping number) and prints numbers starting from 1 up to n.

## 2. Sum of Natural Numbers
Natural numbers include all positive integers from 1 to infinity, not including zero. Write a recursive function `sum(int n)` that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n.

## 3. Even Numbers in a Range
Write a recursive function `printEvens(int start, int end)` that prints all even numbers between start and end (inclusive).

## 4. Reverse a String
Write a recursive function `reverse(String s)` that takes a string s and returns it reversed.

## 5. Check if a String is a Palindrome
Write a recursive function `isPalindrome(String s)` to check if a string is a palindrome.

## 6. Power Function
Write a recursive function `power(int base, int exponent)` that computes base raised to the power of exponent.

*Example:* `power(2, 3) → 8`

## 7. Decimal to Binary Conversion
Write a recursive function `toBinary(int n)` that converts a decimal number n to its binary representation as a string.

*Example:* `toBinary(10) → "1010"`

## 8. Sum of Digits
Write a recursive function `sumOfDigits(int n)` that calculates the sum of the digits of an integer n.

*Example:* `sumOfDigits(1234) → 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`

## 9. Array Sum
Write a recursive function `sumArray(int[] arr, int n)` that calculates the sum of the first n elements in an array.

*Example:* `sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4], 4) → 10`

## 10. Find Maximum in an Array
Write a recursive function `findMax(int[] arr, int n)` to find the maximum value in the first n elements of an array.

## 11. Count Occurrences of a Character
Write a recursive function `countChar(String s, char c)` that counts how many times the character c appears in the string s.

*Example:* `countChar("hello", 'l') → 2`

## 12. Subsets of a Set
Write a recursive function `generateSubsets(String s)` to print all subsets of a string s.

*Example:* `generateSubsets("abc") → "", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"`
